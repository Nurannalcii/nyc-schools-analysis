# NYC Schools Data Analysis
NYC Schools Data Analysis – A Python-driven data pipeline for cleaning, transforming, and integrating NYC school datasets into a PostgreSQL database.

This project is part of the Webeet.io Data Onboarding Program.  
It demonstrates a complete **data pipeline** — from raw datasets to analysis and database integration using **Python and PostgreSQL**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Cleaned, analyzed, and integrated NYC school datasets using Python and SQL  
- Built clear and consistent data structures aligned with PostgreSQL schema  
- Documented findings, key insights, and workflows in Markdown for each task  
- Organized project by **task-based structure** (not by days)

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies  

| Library | Purpose / Why It Was Used |

| **pandas** | To read CSV files, manipulate datasets as DataFrames, and execute SQL queries with `pd.read_sql()` |
| **numpy** | Provides numerical operations and supports Pandas in handling large numeric datasets |
| **sqlalchemy** | Enables Python-to-PostgreSQL connection via `create_engine` and allows SQL queries within Python |
| **psycopg2-binary** | PostgreSQL adapter used by SQLAlchemy to connect and execute queries |
| **matplotlib** | Used for data visualization — creating bar charts, line charts, and other plots (`plt.bar()`, `plt.plot()`) |
| **jupyter** | Required to run `.ipynb` notebooks and manage interactive data analysis workflows |
| **notebook** | Supports the Jupyter interface; ensures compatibility with JupyterLab and local notebook execution |
